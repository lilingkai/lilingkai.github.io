      <title>Cloud Atlas</title>
      <link>http://lilingkai.github.io/posts/cloud-atlas-review/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;&amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A daring work of art showcasing what the magic of cinema has to offer! &amp;ldquo;Cloud Atlas&amp;rdquo; manages to be a science-fiction, historical drama, action, mystery, thriller, romance, comedy, and much more. There are six different story lines, spanning from the 1800’s to the 2300’s or so, all told together beyond the bounds of narrative continuity. The same actors are used in multiple story lines, disguised in makeup and costumed so cleverly that sometimes they are unrecognizable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film is almost 3 hours, yet I was never bored. To be honest, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have minded if it were longer just to flesh out some of the story lines. I normally would attempt to give a short description of the plot, but I think I would just lose you all the same in trying to describe the six different timelines and all their characters. Sometimes, it is better to just sit back and watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, such a complex film warrants discussion as to what it all means. I can throw out a few ideas: connection, separation, time, friendship, love, life. But to pinpoint the film to a single ideology is perhaps as fruitless as trying to catch the clouds. I like to think of “Cloud Atlas” as a film to be enjoyed much like how one sits back and watches the clouds naturally transform to different shapes, taking our imaginations on a grand adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Director: Tom Tykwer, Andy and Lana Wachowski&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starring: Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Doona Bae, Bem Wjosjaw, Keith David, James D&amp;rsquo;Arcy, Xun Zhou, David Gyasi, Susan Sarandon, Hugh Grant&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Princess Mononoke</title>
      <link>http://lilingkai.github.io/posts/mononoke-hime-review/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;&amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hayao Miyazaki proves he is a true master of storytelling in this battle between nature and humans, love and hate, war and peace, life and death. The story is set during medieval Japan, right at the coming of the Iron Age, where humans either live in peace with nature or die trying to tame it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first moments of the movie, we meet Ashitaka, the prince of a small, peaceful village in the East. Suddenly, the village is under attack by a cursed boar-god with skin made of writhing grey worms. Ashitaka successfully defeats this demon, but in the process, his arm was infected by the same curse that afflicted the boar-god. In order to find a way to lift the curse, he sets off on a journey to the West, where he finds himself in the middle of a war between the forest gods, an iron-working colony, and the samurai enclave nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miyazaki doesn&amp;rsquo;t make morality come so easily as there is no clear good vs. evil here; most human characters have two sides to them, and the forest gods are drawn not like &amp;ldquo;Bambi&amp;rdquo; animals but like fierce creatures who can and will kill if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The level of detail in the animation is astounding, and the complexity of the film is unrivaled by other animated films and most live-actions as well. The hand-drawn frames certainly bring an atmospheric quality to the film, and while it might not look as slick as some of the computer-assisted films like “Spirited Away”, the film is still beautiful to watch. This is all supplemented by Joe Hisaishi’s exquisite film score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a fantastical story of epic proportions. I have probably seen this movie at least a dozen times now, and it never fails to impress me time and time again. Bravo Miyazaki, bravo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Director: Hayao Miyazaki&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PG-13, 134 min.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>American Beauty</title>
      <link>http://lilingkai.github.io/posts/american-beauty-review/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;&amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have probably seen this film six or seven times at this point, and it remains one of my favorite movies of all time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;American Beauty” is the story of Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), a middle-aged father who awakens from his mid-life slump thanks to his infatuation with his daughter’s best friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of you are already turned off by the description and ready to skip this film; I urge you to reconsider. While the premise of the film is based on a Lolita relationship, the film is more focused on what it has to say about youth, happiness, power, beauty, and life itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cinematography and the performances by the cast, coupled with Thomas Newman&amp;rsquo;s beautiful score, are reason enough to see this film. Kevin Spacey&amp;rsquo;s performance is a marvel and a treat to watch; he plays a character where we see all of his worst qualities, and yet we still love him and root for him all the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a complex and different kind of film than you are probably used to, one where there are no truly good or bad characters and where there are moments so funny that it hurts to keep laughing and others that are so tragic that we are surprised to find ourselves so deeply moved. Almost everyone can relate to the problems of growing old, finding love and happiness, and losing relevancy in their lives, and that&amp;rsquo;s what makes “American Beauty” such a powerful and great film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Director: Sam Mendes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starring: Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R, 122 min&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deux Jours Une Nuit</title>
      <link>http://lilingkai.github.io/posts/duex-jours-une-nuit-review/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;&amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Deux Jours, Une Nuit” (Two Days, One Night) reminds us of the people that are negatively affected by the growing wealth gap and the deteriorating middle class. The Dardenne brothers offer yet another important view into the world of the struggling, everyday Belgian worker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main character, Sandra (Marion Cotillard), is a young Belgian mother who is recovering from clinical depression. However, she returns from her sick leave to find that her boss has given her 16 coworkers a choice: receive 1000 euro bonuses or let Sandra return and keep her job. Sandra’s coworkers have already voted in favor of receiving bonuses, but the boss agrees to give her job back if Sandra can get a majority to change their mind by Monday, leaving her with just one weekend to track down her colleagues and ask them to change their votes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a troubling and unfair predicament for everyone. While no one really wants Sandra to lose her job, the 1000 euros could really come in handy for some of these people. What would you say or do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the premise of the film naturally lends itself to repetition. Even though every coworker’s circumstances are different, we get the idea by the sixth or seventh coworker: they will either change their vote, or simply say no (sometimes not so politely). The formula works, but eventually all good things succumb to the law of diminishing returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s the simplicity and the honesty of the social drama that makes “Deux Jours, Une Nuit” a good film. It also helps that nearly every shot includes Cotillard, whose performance deservedly warranted an Oscar nomination. Her weary eyes, heavy walk, and defeatist emotions accurately portray the life of depression. We truly get the feeling that she’s just fighting to stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it’s not the story of triumphant success that interests us, but the story of just surviving; something that I’m sure we can all relate to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Directors: Jean-Pierre Dardenne, Luc Dardenne&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starring: Marion Cotillard, Fabrizio Rongione&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2014 (Belgium), PG-13, 95 min&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Moonrise Kingdom</title>
      <link>http://lilingkai.github.io/posts/moonrise-kingdom-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;&amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel and see the nostalgia of summer’s end, first love, and youth itself in “Moonrise Kingdom”. Crisp visuals and endearing performances drive this film, and while the ending might be a bit harried, I still smile at the thought of this wonderful little fictional island. It’s easy to let yourself become spellbound by the mini-universes that Wes Anderson creates in his films, and this one is no different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film is set during the summer of 1965 on a New England island where our hero, Sam (Jared Gilman), attends Khaki Scout Camp, and our heroine, Suzy (Kara Hayward), lives with family. Sam and Suzy met last summer and have been plotting their escape from their current living situations since then. The island isn’t very big, but they’re confident they can find their own hideout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their disappearance sparks a search-and-rescue mission from the adult world, led by the island&amp;rsquo;s only police officer (Bruce Willis), the scoutmaster (Edward Norton), and Suzy’s parents, (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand). Even though the world of adults and the world of children were almost always shown separately, I had the feeling that they were not so different from each other in that both were driven by desires and emotion, and that they were all people just trying to figure out life for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps I’m getting ahead of myself. After all, the film has its own on-screen narrator, plays out and looks like a children’s storybook, and has a character who is only referred to as Social Services (Tilda Swinton). Life as it is portrayed in the film isn’t quite like ours, but you might be surprised to find a little bit of yourself in “Moonrise Kingdom”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Director: Wes Anderson&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starring: Jared Gilman, Kara Hayward, Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2012, PG-13, 96 min&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Revenant</title>
      <link>http://lilingkai.github.io/posts/the-revenant-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;&amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it’s not a film I particularly love, I admire “The Revenant” for its beauty, cinematography, and visceral depiction of the wild. This is a film that is meant to be seen on the big screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Revenant” is the survival story of Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), a fur trapper who was betrayed by John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) and left by his companions for dead after being mauled by a bear. It’s a mesmerizing experience, and Alejandro Iñárritu captures the grizzly beauty of the unforgiving mountains and the cold winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy both give great performances, but it’s hard to compare the two. DiCaprio doesn’t have many lines throughout the film, so all of the acting comes from physical action and from the eyes. To portray a man who experiences pain and hardship every step of the journey is certainly not easy, and it’s a haunting performance that makes viewers meditate on the limits of the human body and our drive to survive. Hardy’s character is a bit more nuanced as he has the most dialogue. His American accent is very convincing but sometimes sounds like he has five marbles in his mouth. Not that it really matters anyway, most of the dialogue in the film is not very interesting or cliché.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you don&amp;rsquo;t go see &amp;ldquo;The Revenant&amp;rdquo; for its interesting dialogue (go see &amp;ldquo;The Hateful Eight&amp;rdquo; if you want dialogue); most of the appeal in the film comes from the visuals. However, the luscious pictures start to lose its effect on you as time drags. While the first third of the film will wow most viewers, others might start to feel the length during the middle, and the last third disappoints as it had strange pacing issues and the potential for being interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film also doesn’t establish any substantial emotional connection with the characters. By the end of the film, I couldn’t care less which man would emerge on top. But the film certainly accomplishes its quest to overwhelm our senses with scenes of grit and blood in a wild, beautiful, and dangerous place where humans don’t belong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Director: Alejandro González Iñárritu&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2015, R, 156 min&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Carol</title>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;&amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not by any means an expert on the subject of love, but I believe “Carol” is one of the most realistic and intelligent portrayals of love that I’ve seen in film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on Patricia Highsmith’s novel, “The Price of Salt”, “Carol” is a beautiful love story set in 1950’s New York that features two main characters. The first one we meet is Therese (Rooney Mara), a young, doll-like woman in her 20’s who works in the doll-section of the toy store, but aspires to be a photographer. The other is Carol (Cate Blanchett), a socialite, wife, and mother, who enters the toy store looking to buy a doll for her daughter. It’s in this simple store that the two women first meet and begin their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film does a lot more showing than telling, something that’s all too rare in today’s cinema. Todd Haynes’ restraint creates a romance that doesn’t descend into the land of the hormonal, and it feels a bit more like we’re seeing real people trying to figure out what the other person is thinking and at what level is their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, that wouldn’t have been possible had it not been for Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara’s great performances. It&amp;rsquo;s the subtle gestures in their acting that allow us to see how they fall in love. Blanchett’s poise and voice are bewitching, and Mara draws us in with her a mysterious Hepburn-like character, a bit of an alien “flung out of space” as Carol describes her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all shot with careful detail to depict 1950’s America. The sets and costumes with their record players, cars, furniture, clothing, hair, and cigarettes are immaculately presented. Much of the film is shot through windows, as if we are looking through the glass, wondering what we will discover there. You’ll be pleased to find something beautiful and deeply human looking back at you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Director: Todd Haynes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starring: Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2015, R, 118 min&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Hateful Eight</title>
      <link>http://lilingkai.github.io/posts/the-hateful-eight-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lilingkai.github.io/posts/the-hateful-eight-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3&gt;&amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quentin Tarantino’s eighth film, “The Hateful Eight”, is some sort of twisted game of Clue in the style of a Western, set ten or so years after the American Civil War. Add a stellar cast and a beautiful original score written by Ennio Morricone and we’ve got ourselves a good movie that’s entertaining as hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This film is very different from other Tarantino films, which featured clear protagonists; the characters in “The Hateful Eight” are more complex and certainly more hateful. We’re not sure who to root for since all of them are untrustworthy, making it all the more exciting to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the film does lack some depth. While “Inglorious” and “Django” were set in significant historical events that gave them a sense of something greater than themselves, “The Hateful Eight” seems to be more of a gruesome celebration of the story itself. Still, it’s an impressive story, even if it might not mean anything in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kurt Russell plays a bounty hunter who is transporting the murderer Daisy (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to her hanging. Along the road, he picks up Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), another bounty hunter, and the new sheriff of the town, played by Walton Goggins. When they find shelter at a cabin, we’re introduced to another set of characters: a mysterious cowboy (Michael Madsen), an Englishman (Tim Roth), the Mexican horse caretaker (Demián Bichir), and the Confederate general (Bruce Dern). As the blizzard descends upon them, the cast is officially trapped inside, and the rest of the plot unfolds in the cozy cabin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pacing of this three hour grandiose film could be described with the metaphor of the boiling frog. For those of you who are unfamiliar, if you place a frog in a pot of cold water and turn the stove on low heat, the water will gradually heat up, and before long, the frog will unresistingly allow itself to be boiled to death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the audience is the frog, then the first chapter of the film is the cold water, aptly set in the wintery Wyoming mountainside. The film takes its sweet time assembling its hateful crew together, and tension grows as the water is starting to heat up.  With all the juicy, Tarantino-style dialogue and excellent performances from Jackson, Goggins, and Leigh (to name a few of the standout performances), you don’t even realize two hours has already passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The water is starting to reach the boiling point as we enter the final chapters of the film, which takes a turn for the grotesquely violent side. If you thought “Inglorious” or “Django” was hard to watch, “The Hateful Eight” is much worse. There are moments so gruesome that your stomach might do a flip or two, and others that are so ridiculous that it’s hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Hateful Eight” is perhaps the funniest and definitely the bloodiest Tarantino film to date, and I look forward to seeing what the genius director/writer decides to make next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Director: Quentin Tarantino&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starring: Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2015, R, 187 min&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Joy</title>
      <link>http://lilingkai.github.io/posts/joy-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lilingkai.github.io/posts/joy-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3&gt;&amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the film celebrates strong matriarchal characters and the power of determination, I can’t help but wish “Joy” was better. This is David O. Russell’s third film in a row featuring the talented Jennifer Lawrence, but unlike “Silver Lining’s Playbook” and “American Hustle”, “Joy” is a bumpy ride that isn’t always enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film is loosely based on the life of Joy Mangano, inventor of the Miracle Mop and eventual founder of Home Shopping Network (HSN). The key word here is “loosely”, as much of the film is a fictional recount of Joy’s tale from rags to riches, and the name Mangano is never even mentioned. It’s best to review this film as fiction rather than a biopic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Lawrence does a fine job portraying Joy and makes us care about her and her dreams. It makes scenes with her bloodsucking leech of a family that much harder to watch because each one of them, save for her grandmother and children, seems bent on suffocating her creativity and keeping her in a subservient position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film ultimately suffers from a lack of balance, cohesion, and tonal control. I wasn’t sure whether the film was supposed to be a comedy or drama or both. The scenes that are supposed to be comedic are funny in a feel-bad kind of way since most of them are at the expense of Joy’s happiness. Scenes of despair feel cheapened when they are quickly followed by a scene of triumph. Whether or not these choices were intentional, the end result is the same: a chaotic work that leaves much to be desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Director: David O. Russell&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starring: Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro, Bradley Cooper&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2015, PG-13, 124 min&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Force Awakens</title>
      <link>http://lilingkai.github.io/posts/star-wars-the-force-awakens-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lilingkai.github.io/posts/star-wars-the-force-awakens-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3&gt;&amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most anticipated movie of the year, &amp;ldquo;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&amp;rdquo;, lives up to all the hype, and J. J. Abrams delivers the best early Christmas present I could ask for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seventh installment of the famed franchise arrives three years after George Lucas sold Lucasfilm to Disney. The sale allowed Disney to take control of the story, and they decided to depart from Lucas&amp;rsquo; original outline. Sounds scary I know, but the fandom can rest assured as the Force is apparently strong with Disney, and they&amp;rsquo;ve created a brilliant space opera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like the original trilogy, “The Force Awakens” is a classic good versus bad story, but this time it’s fueled with exciting new characters, Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), and Poe (Oscar Isaac) alongside the iconic originals, Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). The film takes place three decades after the events of “Return of the Jedi” and the familiar slanted word scroll fills us in with the details of the past thirty years. In short: Luke Skywalker has vanished, and in his absence, the ashes of the old Empire have given birth to The First Order, a new threat to all peaceful systems and planets. It’s a race to see who can find Luke faster; the bad guys need to destroy the last Jedi knight, and the good guys need him to lead their side to victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abrams tells the story with masterful pacing and balance. From action sequences to character development or sentimental drama to comic relief, the film never misses a beat. The plot is always driving forward, yet it seems to take its time traveling through the magnificent world that has been built, complete with its own eclectic mix of alien species and droids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seamless integration of new and old characters is a true testament to the success of the film. The new characters are never overshadowed by the old, and Ridley and Boyega have great chemistry with Ford, who acts as a sort of father figure while retaining the grumpy and irreverent attitude of Han Solo that fans have come to know and love. It’s safe to say that many viewers will walk out of the theater finding that while Luke, Han, and Leia still hold a special place in their hearts, they&amp;rsquo;ve also made room for the young Rey and Finn (and the adorable droid, BB-8).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the film isn’t perfect, but was perfection ever a feasibility? It certainly isn&amp;rsquo;t possible to please everybody. Some fans might be disappointed with the supposed power of the Dark Side, or the fact that the plot errs on the safe side. But for every &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo;, there are ten more things that Abrams gets right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To discuss the film in further detail here would be a crime; just go and experience what the whole world is buzzing about for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Episode VIII” is scheduled for release on May 26, 2017. It’s going to be a long seventeen months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Director: J.J. Abrams&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starring: Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Adam Driver, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2015, PG-13, 135 min&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Guide to my Film Review Style</title>

&lt;p&gt;The basic format of my film reviews consist of 2 parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My rating on a 5 star scale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A short review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-5-star-rating-system&#34;&gt;The 5 Star Rating System&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system is quite similar to the “Little Man System”, which was conceived by Mick LaSalle, film critic for the San Francisco Chronicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;This rating is reserved for what I believe are great examples of film from that genre or time period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733&lt;/h3&gt; sa

Thumbs up. Definitely good, very enjoyable, and not quite great. People are justified in buying these kinds of films for their movie collection.

&lt;h3&gt;&amp;#9733 &amp;#9733 &amp;#9733&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;RTR, which stands for read the review. Nothing screams &amp;ldquo;GRAY AREA&amp;rdquo; more than the middle of the spectrum. A 3-star rating is a bit ambiguous; it could be an almost-good-but-not-quite film or an almost-bad-but-not-quite film. In general, I give it to films that are decent, but not exceptional. As LaSalle elaborates, “If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t transcend the genre, it will mean that someone not drawn to the genre wouldn&amp;rsquo;t like it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&amp;#9733 &amp;#9733&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Thumbs down. Definitely bad and not worth seeing. These films usually have some redeeming qualities, but not nearly enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&amp;#9733&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Absolutely terrible. There are few and often no merits to the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-short-review&#34;&gt;The Short Review&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My ultimate goal with the short review is to showcase the film’s merits (or lack thereof) without giving too much of the plot away. If you are looking for detailed plot summaries, go look it up on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, people mostly skip the reviews and go straight to the ratings anyways. So for those of you who do take time out of your busy lives to read reviews, I try to make it easier by making my reviews short and simple. Many of them sit around 300 words or less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that my thoughts on the film are at least somewhat helpful and insightful, and that you enjoy the world of film as much as I do.&lt;/p&gt;

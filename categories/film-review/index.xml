      <title>Green Book</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Green Book” advertises itself as a racially-themed, crowd-pleasing, feel-good film, and it succeeds on all fronts, as long as you don’t think too hard about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week’s review follows a different format called “Poops and Praises” where I just list what I liked (praises) and what I didn’t like (poops). However, before I get into that:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Velvet Buzzsaw</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I normally steer far away from horror films, but when I heard that the director of “Nightcrawler” had teamed up with Jake Gyllenhaal again to release a satire horror film on Netflix, my curiosity got the best of me. Despite its categorization of horror, I found the film to be surprisingly funny and was laughing more often than I was scared, whether that was the film’s intention or not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The experience of watching “The Commuter” ends up being like most commutes: we know where we’re headed, and the train gets us there somewhat reliably, but the ride isn’t all that memorable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lost in Translation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A perhaps under-watched gem from the early 2000’s, “Lost in Translation” offers us insights into the lives of two lost souls in Tokyo that reminds of us of our most basic needs: connection, happiness, and purpose in life. It’s a smart, hilarious, sad yet sweet film that deserves eyes on it even 16 years after its release.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tomb Raider</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As far as video-game based movies go, the 2018 “Tomb Raider” reboot isn’t terrible, but it fails to stand out in the action-saturated movie market we have today and largely feels like a wasted opportunity to revive the failed franchise from 15 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alfonso Cuarón displays his mastery of cinema in this intensely personal film based on the memories of his childhood. It’s a film whose narrative rides on life events, but like many of our own lives, the best moments are often separated with stretches of dull everyday monotony.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Coen Brothers venture into the Wild West yet again with “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs”, but this time, they return with just a few specks of gold and a mound of dirt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me just say that while many genres have my sympathy, the superhero genre is usually not one of them. With the exception of Nolan&amp;rsquo;s Batman films, I find many superhero movies to be rather lukewarm with their predictable outcomes and action scenes for the sake of action. However, Wonder Woman blew away all of my expectations and more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Revenant</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While it’s not a film I particularly love, I admire “The Revenant” for its beauty, cinematography, and visceral depiction of the wild. This is a film that is meant to be seen on the big screen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am not by any means an expert on the subject of love, but I believe “Carol” is one of the most realistic and intelligent portrayals of love that I’ve seen in film.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Hateful Eight</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quentin Tarantino’s eighth film, “The Hateful Eight”, is some sort of twisted game of Clue in the style of a Western, set ten or so years after the American Civil War. Add a stellar cast and a beautiful original score written by Ennio Morricone and we’ve got ourselves a good movie that’s entertaining as hell.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://kevinwli.com/post/2015-12-30-joy-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the film celebrates strong matriarchal characters and the power of determination, I can’t help but wish “Joy” was better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most anticipated movie of the year, &amp;ldquo;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&amp;rdquo;, lives up to all the hype, and J. J. Abrams delivers the best early Christmas present I could ask for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week’s review follows a different format called “Poops and Praises” where I just list what I liked (praises) and what I didn’t like (poops). However, before I get into that:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I normally steer far away from horror films, but when I heard that the director of “Nightcrawler” had teamed up with Jake Gyllenhaal again to release a satire horror film on Netflix, my curiosity got the best of me. Despite its categorization of horror, I found the film to be surprisingly funny and was laughing more often than I was scared, whether that was the film’s intention or not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The experience of watching “The Commuter” ends up being like most commutes: we know where we’re headed, and the train gets us there somewhat reliably, but the ride isn’t all that memorable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A perhaps under-watched gem from the early 2000’s, “Lost in Translation” offers us insights into the lives of two lost souls in Tokyo that reminds of us of our most basic needs: connection, happiness, and purpose in life. It’s a smart, hilarious, sad yet sweet film that deserves eyes on it even 16 years after its release.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As far as video-game based movies go, the 2018 “Tomb Raider” reboot isn’t terrible, but it fails to stand out in the action-saturated movie market we have today and largely feels like a wasted opportunity to revive the failed franchise from 15 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alfonso Cuarón displays his mastery of cinema in this intensely personal film based on the memories of his childhood. It’s a film whose narrative rides on life events, but like many of our own lives, the best moments are often separated with stretches of dull everyday monotony.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Coen Brothers venture into the Wild West yet again with “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs”, but this time, they return with just a few specks of gold and a mound of dirt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

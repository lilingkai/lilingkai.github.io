      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like my ancestors used to say, “with Adam Sandler, you can’t expect a good movie, but you can expect a good time”. Ok, they didn’t say that exactly, but it perfectly describes “Murder Mystery”, a film that could maybe make your otherwise uneventful Tuesday night somewhat entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month, Netflix released its much anticipated film, “Always Be My Maybe”, and adds yet another notch to its growing list of original romantic comedies. While I always appreciate when a modern film is led by an Asian cast, I can’t help but wish the film was more creative and cohesive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over 10 years of movies have led up to the “Avengers: Endgame”, and the Russo’s deliver a satisfying and enjoyable conclusion for their most loyal fans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Donald Glover released his latest artistic endeavor last month on Amazon Prime, and this time it’s a short film by the name of “Guava Island”. Most art that Donald churns out is of high quality, and for the most part, “Guava Island” is no exception. Yet, there is a feeling of squandered opportunities here that make it feel less like a powerful short film and more like a long, self-glorifying music video.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Noah Centineo plays another fake boyfriend in yet another Netflix teenage rom-com in “The Perfect Date”, but does this one warrant your time? The short answer: no.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here comes another “Poops &amp;amp; Praises”, a style of review where I just list what I liked (praises) and what I didn’t like (poops). Warning, there are mild spoilers ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I normally steer far away from horror films, but when I heard that the director of “Nightcrawler” had teamed up with Jake Gyllenhaal again to release a satire horror film on Netflix, my curiosity got the best of me. Despite its categorization of horror, I found the film to be surprisingly funny and was laughing more often than I was scared, whether that was the film’s intention or not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Donald Glover released his latest artistic endeavor last month on Amazon Prime, and this time it’s a short film by the name of “Guava Island”. Most art that Donald churns out is of high quality, and for the most part, “Guava Island” is no exception. Yet, there is a feeling of squandered opportunities here that make it feel less like a powerful short film and more like a long, self-glorifying music video.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here comes another “Poops &amp;amp; Praises”, a style of review where I just list what I liked (praises) and what I didn’t like (poops). Warning, there are mild spoilers ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I normally steer far away from horror films, but when I heard that the director of “Nightcrawler” had teamed up with Jake Gyllenhaal again to release a satire horror film on Netflix, my curiosity got the best of me. Despite its categorization of horror, I found the film to be surprisingly funny and was laughing more often than I was scared, whether that was the film’s intention or not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

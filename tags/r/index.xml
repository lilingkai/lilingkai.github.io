      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yorgos Lanthimos’ latest film, “The Favourite” is a critically acclaimed and highly divisive Best Picture nominee, and after watching, I can certainly see why. This is an English tea time snack with snappy bite and wickedly dark aftertaste.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week’s review brings the second installment in “Poops &amp;amp; Praises”, a style of review where I just list what I liked (praises) and what I didn’t like (poops).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I normally steer far away from horror films, but when I heard that the director of “Nightcrawler” had teamed up with Jake Gyllenhaal again to release a satire horror film on Netflix, my curiosity got the best of me. Despite its categorization of horror, I found the film to be surprisingly funny and was laughing more often than I was scared, whether that was the film’s intention or not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A perhaps under-watched gem from the early 2000’s, “Lost in Translation” offers us insights into the lives of two lost souls in Tokyo that reminds of us of our most basic needs: connection, happiness, and purpose in life. It’s a smart, hilarious, sad yet sweet film that deserves eyes on it even 16 years after its release.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alfonso Cuarón displays his mastery of cinema in this intensely personal film based on the memories of his childhood. It’s a film whose narrative rides on life events, but like many of our own lives, the best moments are often separated with stretches of dull everyday monotony.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Coen Brothers venture into the Wild West yet again with “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs”, but this time, they return with just a few specks of gold and a mound of dirt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While it’s not a film I particularly love, I admire “The Revenant” for its beauty, cinematography, and visceral depiction of the wild. This is a film that is meant to be seen on the big screen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am not by any means an expert on the subject of love, but I believe “Carol” is one of the most realistic and intelligent portrayals of love that I’ve seen in film.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quentin Tarantino’s eighth film, “The Hateful Eight”, is some sort of twisted game of Clue in the style of a Western, set ten or so years after the American Civil War. Add a stellar cast and a beautiful original score written by Ennio Morricone and we’ve got ourselves a good movie that’s entertaining as hell.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
